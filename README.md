## Features
- Share drawings as PNG images via QR Code
- Drawing tools: Pencil, Line, Eraser, Rectangle, Circle, Flood Fill
- Undo, Redo stack
- 3 Drawing Save slots
- Adjustable Draw Width
- Adjustable Draw speed (Fast, Medium, Slow, Pixel Step)
- 2 Draw colors (Black and White)


## Usage
Button Controls:
- `D-Pad`: Move cursor
- `A`: Draws with tool
- `B`: Cancel tool action / Teleport cursor between menu and drawing areas
- `SELECT + UP/DOWN`: Adjust Cursor Speed
- `SELECT + LEFT/RIGHT`: Adjust Drawing Width
- `START`: Create QRCode

The cursor movement has a small amount of inertia while in the drawing areas.
It will apply as long as some button is being held down, and resets to zero
when all buttons are released. This helps with drawing curves using a D-Pad,
which otherwise tends toward right angles and diagonals.


## Sending to Mobile Phone

### Scanners
Known **working** QRCode scanners:
- Android Binary Eye
- Android Camera (in scan mode)
- Web: https://scanqr.org

Known **not working** scanners:
- "Camera" app on some Samsung phones
- Default "Camera" app on iOS

### Browsers
Known **working** Browsers:
(via "share-to" or pasting in the url, not via the browser's own scanner)
- Firefox/Fennec Web Browser (Android mobile, Linux desktop)
- Chromium (Linux desktop)

Known **not working** Browsers:
- Chromium/Chrome (Android)


## Techincal details
The drawing is limited to 96x96 monochrome pixels due to QRCode
size limits and the current lack of PNG DEFLATE compression.

The process is:
- Convert: GB Drawing -> Indexed PNG -> Base64 Encode -> mime url -> QRCode
- Share to phone: QRCode -> Scanner app -> Share to Web Browser


## The Emulator .sav files are PNGs! 
The `.sav` files generated by emulators for this ROM can be opened in many paint
programs since the first cart SRAM bank contains an indexed PNG of the last
drawing image that was exported as a QRCode.


## Dev Tools Used
- GBDK-2020 (4.5.0+)
