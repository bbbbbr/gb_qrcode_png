https://github.com/bbbbbr/gameboy_qr_paint


## Overview
Draw on the Game Boy and share it direct to your phone using a QRCode!
(without the internet!)


## Usage
Drawing Controls:
- `D-Pad`: Move cursor
- `A`: Draw pixels
- `B`: Draw line from last press or last pixel drawn
- `A+B`: Clear drawing
- `START`: Create QRCode


## Sending to Mobile Phone
Known working QRCode scanners:
- Android Binary Eye
- Android Camera (in scan mode)

Known working Browsers
(via "share-to" or pasting in the url, not via the browser's own scanner)
- Firefox/Fennec Web Browser (Android mobile, Linux desktop)
- Chromium (Linux desktop)


## Techincal details
The drawing is limited to 96x96 monochrome pixels due to QRCode
size limits and the current lack of PNG DEFLATE compression.

The process is:
- Convery: GB Drawing -> Indexed PNG -> Base64 Encode -> mime url -> QRCode
- Share to phone: QRCode -> Scanner app -> Share to Web Browser


## The Emulator .sav files are PNGs! 
The `.sav` files generated by emulators for this ROM can be opened in many paint
programs since the first cart SRAM bank contains the drawing image formatted as
an indexed PNG.


## Dev Tools Used
